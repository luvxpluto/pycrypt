# Pycrypt

Pycrypt is a Python cryptography library that provides functionalities for encrypting and decrypting texts using various cryptographic algorithms, such as Caesar, Key, Vigenère, Morse Code, Binary, and Atbash.


## Features
- Ability to encrypt and decrypt text using different encryption algorithms.
- Ability to decrypt text using different encryption algorithms.

## Implemented Encryption Algorithms
**1. Caesar Cipher**

The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution technique where each letter of the original text is replaced by another letter that is a fixed number of positions ahead in the alphabet.

**2. Keyword Cipher**

The Keyword cipher is a variant of the Caesar cipher that uses a word or phrase as a key to determine the character shifting in the original text.

**3. Vigenère Cipher**

The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher that uses a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

**4. Morse code**

Morse code is a system of representing letters and numbers using sequences of short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes).

**5.Binary Cipher**

The binary cipher is an encoding method that represents text characters using a sequence of zeros and ones.

**6.Atbash Cipher**

The Atbash cipher is a substitution technique where each letter of the alphabet is replaced by its counterpart in the reverse order of the alphabet.
