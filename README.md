# Pycrypt

Pycrypt is a Python cryptography library that provides functionalities for encrypting and decrypting texts using various cryptographic algorithms, such as Caesar, Key, Vigenère, Morse Code, Binary, and Atbash. Additionally, it includes the ability to send and read encrypted emails using the aforementioned algorithms.


## Features
- Ability to encrypt and decrypt text using different encryption algorithms.
- Functionality to send encrypted emails using any of the algorithms.
- Functionality to read encrypted emails and decrypt them using the corresponding algorithms.

## Implemented Encryption Algorithms
**1. Caesar Cipher**

The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution technique where each letter of the original text is replaced by another letter that is a fixed number of positions ahead in the alphabet.

**2. Keyword Cipher**

The Keyword cipher is a variant of the Caesar cipher that uses a word or phrase as a key to determine the character shifting in the original text.

**3. Vigenère Cipher**

The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher that uses a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

**4. Morse code**

Morse code is a system of representing letters and numbers using sequences of short signals (dots) and long signals (dashes).

**5.Binary Cipher**

The binary cipher is an encoding method that represents text characters using a sequence of zeros and ones.

**6.Atbash Cipher**

The Atbash cipher is a substitution technique where each letter of the alphabet is replaced by its counterpart in the reverse order of the alphabet.
